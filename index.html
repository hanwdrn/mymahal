            <p>I know our relationship did not start just like what a good and healthy relationship would do, but I will try my best every day to make you feel loved and you'll get everything that you deserve. I love you so much that even words aren't enough to describe it. Thank you for sticking with me through my darkest times. Please bear with me until all of what happened finally just turns into a wound. Mahal na mahal kita, mahal ko. Sana nararamdaman mo. If nagkukulang mana ako, sorry. I've been so indecisive my whole life, but one thing for sure is, siguradong sigurado ako na ikaw at ikaw lang piliin ko. Thank you for giving me another reason why I wanna live. Ikaw lang ang rason kung bakit nandito pa 'ko ngayon, mahal. I love you! Happy monthsary!</p>
